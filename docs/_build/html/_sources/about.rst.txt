What is Zeek?
-------------

Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyzer used for network security monitoring (NSM) and various traffic analysis tasks.

It generates detailed logs of network activity in tab-separated or JSON formats, including HTTP sessions, DNS requests, SSL certificates, and SMTP sessions. Zeek includes built-in malware detection, software vulnerability reporting, and SSL certificate validation. Its Turing-complete scripting language allows for custom traffic analysis. Zeek supports high-speed networks with scalable load-balancing and cluster setups managed by ZeekControl, running on commodity hardware. It is cost-effective and ideal for generating high-fidelity network logs, distinguishing it from signature-based IDS like Suricata and protocol analyzers like Wireshark.


Why Zeek?
---------

Zeek is an open-source network traffic analyzer beneficial for security and network teams. It focuses on collecting and analyzing network data, offering transaction data, extracted content, and alert data. Zeek generates detailed transaction logs, carves files from network traffic, and provides alerts via its notice mechanism. While not optimized for full content data collection, Zeek excels in customizable traffic analysis and can run on commodity hardware, making it a cost-effective solution for understanding network usage and detecting suspicious activity.


History of Zeek:
----------------

Zeek, initially called "Bro," was created by Vern Paxson in 1995 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). First deployed in 1996, Zeekâ€™s development has been supported by various organizations, including NSF, ICSI, DOE, and NCSA. Originally designed for detecting network intrusions, Zeek evolved through contributions from researchers and students, integrating academic insights with practical applications.

In 2010, NSF funded a significant overhaul of Zeek, leading to the 2.0 release in 2012. Notable enhancements included IPv6 support, the Bro Center of Expertise, and tools like try.zeek.org and the Zeek package manager.

In 2018, the software was renamed from Bro to Zeek to better align with community values and avoid negative connotations. The first release under the new name was Zeek 3.0 in 2019. Since then, Zeek has focused on expanding its community and enhancing user engagement through various platforms.
