Zeek Logs
=========

Zeek is a powerful network security monitoring tool that generates various log files capturing network activity. Among these logs, the `zeek.log` file stands out as a comprehensive summary, consolidating critical information from different log sources. In this documentation, we'll delve into the structure of the `zeek.log` file, its significance, the logs it aggregates, and how to leverage it for network analysis and security monitoring. 


Introduction to Zeek Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `zeek.log` file serves as a centralized repository of key network events and observations generated by Zeek. It aggregates data from multiple log sources, providing a holistic view of network activity within a given timeframe. Each entry in the `zeek.log` encapsulates essential details, allowing network administrators and security analysts to gain insights into network behavior, detect anomalies, and respond to security incidents promptly.


Log Files Generated in `zeek.log`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `zeek.log` file aggregates information from various logs generated by Zeek. These logs include:

- **Conn.log**: Records details of network connections, including timestamps, IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, connection 
states, duration, bytes exchanged, and more.

- **DNS.log**: Captures DNS queries and responses, providing insights into domain name resolution requests, queried domain names, client IPs, response IPs, and protocols used.

- **HTTP.log**: Logs HTTP requests and responses, offering visibility into web traffic, request methods, URIs, user-agents, response codes, content lengths, and more.

- **Weird.log**: Highlights anomalous network events detected by Zeek, such as irregular behavior, suspicious connections, or potential security threats.

- **SSL.log**: Records SSL/TLS handshake details, cipher suites, certificate information, and other SSL-related data for encrypted connections.

- **SMTP.log**: Provides information about Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) activity, including email transactions, sender and recipient addresses, and SMTP commands.

- **X509.log**: Logs details of X.509 certificates observed in SSL/TLS connections, including certificate chains, validity periods, 
subject and issuer information, and cryptographic parameters.

- **FTP.log**: Captures FTP (File Transfer Protocol) activity, including login attempts, file transfers, commands issued, and response codes.

- **Files.log**: Records file-related activity, such as file creation, deletion, and transfers, along with metadata such as file hashes, sizes, and MIME types.

- **SMB.log**: Logs Server Message Block (SMB) protocol activity, including file sharing, authentication attempts, and file access events.

- **Kerberos.log**: Provides details of Kerberos authentication events, including ticket requests, renewals, and authentication failures.

- **Software.log**: Records software installation and execution events observed on network hosts, including executable names, paths, and associated metadata.


Log File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The structure of the `zeek.log` file is designed for ease of understanding and analysis. Each log entry consists of the following main components:


- **Timestamp**: Time at which the event occurred, providing temporal context for analysis.

- **Event Type**: Indicates the type of event captured, such as connection establishment, DNS query, HTTP request, etc.

- **Event Details**: Specific information relevant to the event type, including IP addresses, port numbers, protocol used, duration, 
bytes exchanged, and more.

- **Additional Metadata**: Supplementary data that enhances the context of the event, aiding in comprehensive analysis and investigation.


Understanding Log Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entries in the `zeek.log` file represent significant network occurrences observed by Zeek during its monitoring process. These events encompass various aspects of network communication, including:


- **Connection Establishment**: Details of network connections, such as source and destination IPs, ports, protocols, connection states, and duration.

- **DNS Queries and Responses**: Information about domain name resolution requests, including queried domain names, client IPs, response IPs, and protocol used.

- **HTTP Requests and Responses**: Insights into web traffic, encompassing details of HTTP transactions, such as request methods, URIs, user-agents, response codes, and content lengths.

- **Anomalous Network Events**: Detection of irregular network behavior, anomalies, and potential security threats, as identified by Zeek's analysis.


Analyzing Zeek Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `zeek.log` file serves as a valuable resource for network analysis, threat detection, and incident response. By examining log entries systematically, analysts can:

- **Detect Anomalies**: Identify deviations from normal network behavior, such as suspicious connections, unusual DNS queries, or malicious HTTP requests.

- **Investigate Security Incidents**: Perform detailed investigations into security events, tracing the origin and impact of potential threats within the network.

- **Monitor Network Performance**: Assess network performance metrics, analyze traffic patterns, and optimize resource utilization based on observed behavior.

- **Enhance Security Posture**: Proactively mitigate security risks, implement access controls, and strengthen defense mechanisms to safeguard against threats.


The `zeek.log` file serves as a cornerstone of network security monitoring and analysis, providing invaluable insights into network activity and potential security threats. By leveraging the structured data captured within this log, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture, mitigate risks, and ensure the integrity and resilience of their network infrastructure.
