Sphinx, a documentation generator for Python projects, uses reStructuredText (reST) for formatting documentation. Headings in reStructuredText are indicated by the adornment (i.e., the characters underlining or overlining the heading text). Here are the common styles for Sphinx headings:

### Section Titles
1. **Title**
   ```
   Title
   =====
   ```

2. **Chapter**
   ```
   Chapter
   -------
   ```

3. **Subchapter**
   ```
   Subchapter
   ~~~~~~~~~~
   ```

4. **Section**
   ```
   Section
   ^^^^^^^
   ```

5. **Subsection**
   ```
   Subsection
   **********
   ```

6. **Subsubsection**
   ```
   Subsubsection
   +++++++++++++
   ```

7. **Paragraph**
   ```
   Paragraph
   """""""""
   ```

8. **Subparagraph**
   ```
   Subparagraph
   ............
   ```

### Example
Here's an example showing different heading levels in a reStructuredText file:
```rst

In Sphinx documentation, the hierarchy of the headings should be consistent throughout the document to ensure proper structure and readability.
